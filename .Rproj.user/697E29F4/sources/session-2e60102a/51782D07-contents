# Recitation Topics (DELETE!!!)

- review anatomy of the upper vocal tract- **print out the blank sheet** and have students fill it in

- review consonant articulation: voicing, place, manner







---

class: center, middle

# Review (from lecture)

---

# Review

Last week was **vowels**, now we're moving on to the other main type of segment in phonetics... **consonants!**

--

**Vowel vs. consonant articulation**

- vowels have **unobstructed airflow** 

- consonants have either **partial or complete obstruction** in the vocal tract 

--

- vowels are **voiced** 

- consonants *may or may not be* **voiced**

---

# Consonant features 

**Voicing:** vibration of the vocal cords

**Place:** where is the obstruction of airflow in the vocal tract?

**Manner** what type of obstruction of airflow occurs?


---

# Consonant features

The **columns** are for ***place*** 

The **rows** are for ***manner***

When there's two in a cell, the **right** is **voiced**

# Review (place of articulation)

**Where is the obstruction in the vocal tract?**

- Labials: lips

  - **bilabials:** both lips
  
  - **Labiodentals:** lower lips and upper teeth

--

- Coronals: between the tongue tip/blade and the front part of the mouth

  - **dentals:** tongue and teeth 
  
  - **alveolars:** tongue and alveolar ridge
  
  - **postalveolars:** tongue and the space right behind alveolar ridge

---

# Review (place of articulation)

**Where is the obstruction in the vocal tract?**

- **retroflexes:** the tongue tip is arched backward

--

- **palatals:** tongue body raised against the hard palate 

--

- **velars:** back of tongue against the soft palate (=velum)

--

- gutturals: pronounced in the very back of the mouth 
  
  - **uvulars:** back of tongue against the uvula
  
  - **pharyngeals:** root of tongue obstructing the pharynx
  
  - **glottals:** vocal folds obstructing the glottis
  


---

# Review (manner of articulation)

***What type of obstruction is it?*** 

- is it complete blockage of airflow?

  - stops/plosives
  
  - stops can be **aspirated** (pronounced with a tiny [h] sound after the obstruction is released)
  
  - trills, taps, flaps: obstruction doesn't last long enough to cause a release of pressure at the end
  
--

- is it partial blockage of airflow?

  - fricatives 
  
  - approximants (less obstruction than fricatives)
  
  - laterals (obstruction in the center, but air flows past the tongue on the side(s))
  

---

# Review (manner of articulation)

***What type of obstruction is it?***

- is the airflow blocked in *one part* of the vocal tract but allowed to flow through a different part?

  - affricates: a combination between stops and fricatives

  - nasals: complete obstruction through the **oral cavity** but air is redirected to flow through the **nasal cavity**

---

# Review (manner sound classes)

Manner of articulation can be grouped into **sound classes**

- **rhotics:** *r*-like sounds

- **liquids:** rhotics + laterals 
--

- **obstruents:** consonants with more obstruction 

  - *stops, fricatives, affricates*

--

- **sonorants:** consonants with less obstruction

  - *nasals, liquids, approximants*
