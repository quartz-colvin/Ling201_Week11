# Review from lecture 

Now we're looking at the smallest element of language: **sounds**!

--

- **Phonetics & phonology:** study of the sounds of language

--

**Phonetics:** study of speech sounds as a physical phenomenon

--

**Phonology:** study of how languages organize speech sounds into a system

--

- organization into words, in certain contexts, which sounds are contrastive... etc.




---

# Sound =/= Spelling 

---

# Sound vs. Spelling 

- no language has a writing system (orthography) that perfectly represents its speech sounds, and there are reasons for this

--

  - pronunciation **changes over time**! writing doesn't always reflect these changes, though (examples: *knight, gnat*)

--

  - pronunciation **varies by place and social group**! writing doesn't usually reflect this variation (examples: *pecan, caramel, cot/caught, Mary/marry/merry, bag*)

--

  - **loanwords** often have spellings that reflect the pronunciation in the source language, not target language (examples: *buffet, zucchini*)
    
--

- but it becomes a problem when we want to talk precisely about **phonetics**

**So, how do we accurately represent the pronunciation of a word?**

--

- **A:** Phonetic description of phonemes' features; transcribed with International Phonetic Alphabet

# Vowel articulatory features

---

# Vowel articulatory features (the big 3)

- **Tongue height:** how high is the tongue in the mouth?

--

  - high, mid, low
  
  - can be further divided into tense vs. lax vowels (**lax:** re*lax*ed tongue)

--

- **Tongue backness:** is the tongue further forward or back in the mouth?

--

  - front, central, back

--

- **Lip roundedness:** are the lips rounded or unrounded?

--

  - rounded, unrounded
  
  
---

# Vowel articulatory features

**Articulation:** how the vocal tract moves to produce sounds

.pull-left[
```{r, out.height="100%", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/mouth_vowels.webp")
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r, out.height="100%", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/vowel_space.png")
```
]


---

# Other vowel features!

- **Nasalization:** articulated by lowering the velum/soft palate, so that air flows through both the nose and mouth

--

  - Portuguese *pão* means "bread" but the non-nasal *pao* means "stick" or.....something else inappropriate.

--

  - since adding or removing the nasality feature changes the meaning completely, we can say that nasalization is **contrastive** in Portuguese

--

- **Length:** long vowels contrast with short vowels

--

  - Ojibwe (Algonquian) *nipim* "to live" vs. *niipim* "to be cold"

--

- **Pitch:** tonal languages contrast pitch 

--

  - White Hmong (Hmong-Mien) *kuv* "I" vs. *kuj* "also"

--

  - **Note** in this writing system (RPA), the tone is indicated by the final *written* letter of the word. v = mid-rising tone; j = high falling tone

# International Phonetic Alphabet

To accurately represent speech sounds, we use the **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**

--

- one symbol = one sound

  - these "one sound"s are called **phonemes**

--

- uses the same symbols for all spoken languages 

- all spoken languages use some subset of the symbols on the full IPA chart 

---

# International Phonetic Alphabet

- many IPA symbols represent roughly the same sounds as the corresponding English letter

  - [p, t, k, b, d, g, f, v, s, z, h, m, n, l]

--

- **but,** some IPA symbols do not

  - IPA [ j ] = English *<*y*>* 
  
  - *yes* = [jɛs]

  - [c, q, x] and most vowels **don't** correspond to English letters!
  
---

# International Phonetic Alphabet

IPA is used for **phonetic transcription:** writing the exact sounds of a speech sample

--

**Some conventions:**

- phonetic transcriptions are written between **[square brackets]**

  - [bə.ˈnæ.nə]

--

- orthpgraphy/spelling is written in ***italics*** or in **< angle brackets >**

  - *banana* or *<* banana *>*

--

- **all sounds and only sounds** are written:

  - *phone* [ˈfown] (don't write silent letters, *ph* = one sound [f])
  
--
  
- a dot **(.)** indicates **syllable** divisions: *pronunciation* [prə.ˌnʌn.si.ˈej.ʃən]

- primary and secondary **stress** are indicated with **(ˈ)** and **(ˌ) before** the stressed syllable

---

# Steps for transcription (added after class)

1. say the word out loud 

2. which IPA symbols match **what you're saying**? 

  - its all about what you're saying, and NOT about how the word is written
  
  - you can either describe it based on where you think your tongue is **OR** find the symbol on the interactive chart that sounds closest to what you're saying
  
  - either way, you should get the same result

# Practice! 







---

# Identifying vowels

**(1) Identify which vowels are in the following words, (2) give the IPA symbol for them, and (3) define them using the big three features.**

1. cat **[æ]**

2. thrift **[ɪ]**

3. red **[ɛ]**

4. reed **[i]**

5. hard **[ɑ]**

6. boot **[u]**

7. cut **[ʌ]**

8. pet **[ɛ]**

9. pot **[ɑ] or [ɔ]**

10. fork **[o]**


---

# What about signed languages!?

--

## I added this section for fun :)

---

# Signed languages

**Sign phonemes** are smaller units of the sign

--

They're categorized into five **parameters** which are *further* categorized into **primes**

--

**Parameters:**

- handshape

- palm orientation 

- movement 

- location 

- non-manual signals

---

# Signed languages: Parameters

**Palm orientation**
  
- palms facing up or down, facing the signer, away from the signer, etc.

**Movement** 

- upwards, downwards, diagonally, zigzag, etc.
  
**Location** 

- in the signing space

**Non-manual signals** 

- facial expressions, eyebrow raising/lowering, eye gaze...

- Note: *"manual" = with hands*

---

# Signed languages
